// Variables
let Life = 'I am alive'; // Proof of life

// Notes:
// Leverage the Math.random() function to generate a random number between 1 and 50





// Give the user a prompt to enter their name - We want to use the window prompt
// to ask the user their number





// We want to track the user's number of guesses





// Use if/else and truthy/falsy concepts to evaluate whether or not the user's guess was correct.
// NOTE: If a user's guess is incorrect, respond with a prompt letting them know whether or not their guess was too high or too low and how many chances remain.





// 5. If a user guesses within three chances, display an alert letting the user know they've won and what the number was.





//6. If a user loses, display an alert letting the user know they have lost and reveal the number.





// other goals -- 
// - Return an error message if the user does NOT enter a guess that is a number. Do NOT count that guess as a valid attempt. Let the user know how many guesses remain.
// - Provide a user with the option to restart the game WITHOUT using a loop. This is tricky! Only do this step if you are absolutely finished with all the other requirements and want to push yourself.
